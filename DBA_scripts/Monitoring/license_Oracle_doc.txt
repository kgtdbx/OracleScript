Oracle Database - Enterprise Edition - Version 11.2.0.1 and later
Oracle Database Cloud Schema Service - Version N/A and later
Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine - Version N/A and later
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - Database Service - Version N/A and later

The note describes scripts: options_packs_usage_statistics.sql.
More details on Oracle Database Options and Packs can be found in the Oracle Database Licensing Information guide.

SOLUTION
Database Options/Management Packs Usage Report

You can determine whether an option is currently in use in a database by running options_packs_usage_statistics.sql, which replaces both former scripts option_usage.sql and used_options_details.sql.
You can manually run options_packs_usage_statistics.sql in an individual database or use Oracle Enterprise Manager Job System to automatically run options_packs_usage_statistics.sql on multiple databases.

For Container Databases (CDB):
 - when connected to CDB$ROOT container, the script lists data for all the open PDBs, properly detecting if Multitenant Option licensing is needed.
 - when connected to a PDB, the script lists only local data,  as there is no visibility to other PDBs, due to the isolation  provided by the Multitenant Architecture. For the same reason,  Multitenant Option usage (more than one PDB) cannot be detected.

Description 

The report is divided into two main sections PRODUCT USAGE and FEATURE USAGE DETAILS which reports overview and detailed information for Database Options/Management Packs usage for Oracle Databases for 11.2 and later. You need the "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY" privilege to execute the script.
The report is based on the DBA_FEATURE_USAGE_STATISTICS view. Note that the feature usage data in the view is updated once a week, so it may take up to 7 days for the report to show recent usage of options and/or packs. 
The output can be easily opened in a spreadsheet, if needed.

Please review the Description & Disclaimer section in the script before executing the script.
