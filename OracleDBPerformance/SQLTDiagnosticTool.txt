MAIN CONTENT

What is SQLTXPLAIN (SQLT)?
SQLTXPLAIN, also known as SQLT, is a tool provided by Oracle Server Technologies Center of Expertise - ST CoE. SQLT inputs one SQL statement and outputs a set of diagnostics files. These files are commonly used to diagnose SQL statements performing poorly. SQLT connects to the database and collects execution plans, Cost-based Optimizer CBO statistics, schema objects metadata, performance statistics, configuration parameters, and similar elements that influence the performance of the SQL being analyzed.

For tuning SQL, SQLT requires some level of expertise to get the most from it. For most issues we recommend that you start by checking the query using SQL Health Check and then progress to SQLT if you are unable to resolve the issue. For details of SQLHC see:

Document 1366133.1 SQL Tuning Health-Check Script (SQLHC)
 

Licensing (SQLT requires no license and is FREE)
As in the title of this section, SQLT requires no license and is FREE. 

SQLT can use data from the Oracle Diagnostic and/or the Oracle Tuning Packs if your site has a license for them. For more details refer to the licensing section in the SQLT FAQ:

SQLTXPLAIN REFERENCE MATERIAL
How to get SQLT Installation Advice?
The best place to get SQLT installation advice is the My Oracle Support Community (MOSC). Refer to the following thread: SQLTXPLAIN: SQLT Installation Issues, where you can benefit from the shared experience of the community, ask questions and get help from others.

Troubleshooting SQLT Runtime or Installation Issues
In the event that SQLT raises errors at runtime or during installation or has other installation related issues, refer to:  

Document 1670677.1 FAQ: Common SQLT (SQLTXPLAIN) Runtime/Installation Errors
 As above, the My Oracle Support Community (MOSC) can also provide valuable assistance. 

SQLTXPLAIN Usage Guide
The SQLT usage guide can be found here:

Document 1614107.1 SQLT Usage Instructions
Unless you plan to execute the SQL, you will need to know the SQL_ID or HASH_VALUE of the statement from an AWR or ASH report or you can select it from the database using the V$SQL view. See:

Document 1627387.1 How to Determine the SQL_ID for a SQL Statement
Interpreting the SQLTXPLAIN Main report
You can find some suggestions about how you might be able to use the SQLT main report in the following document:

Document 1922234.1 SQLT Main Report: Usage Suggestions
SQLTXPLAIN FAQ
A FAQ for the SQLT tool can be found here:

Document 1454160.1 FAQ: SQLT (SQLTXPLAIN) Frequently Asked Questions
SQLTXPLAIN Video and Webinars
Additionally number of webcasts covering various SQLT related topics have been recorded, including topics such as:

"Using SQLTXPLAIN to diagnose SQL statements performing poorly"
"How to create in 5 minutes a SQL Tuning Test Case using SQLTXPLAIN".
The webinars can be found, along with many other recorded webcasts, here:

Document 740964.1 Advisor Webcast Archived Recordings
Related to the Testcase webinar, there are some articles outlining how to use SQLT Testcases here:

SQLTXPLAIN (SQLT): General Discussion

Discover discussions about other articles and helpful subjects by clicking here to access the main My Oracle Support Community page for Database Tuning.

Pro-Active Problem Avoidance and Diagnostic Collection
Although some problems may be unforeseen, in many cases problems may be avoidable if signs are detected early enough. Additionally, if an issue does occur, it is no use collecting information about that issue after the event. SQLTXPLAIN is one of the tools that support recommend for collecting such diagnostics. For information on suggested uses, other proactive preparations and diagnostics, see:

Document 1482811.1 Best Practices: Proactively Avoiding Database and Query Performance Issues
