--Task 235798:Get familiar with current/long term cards jobs in Bodi
--https://tfs.isbank.is/tfs/DefaultCollection/HBL/_workitems/edit/235798


/*--https://tfs.isbank.is/tfs/DefaultCollection/HBL/_workitems/edit/203628

Today we are using a a old source for cards products in DW based on Upplys sources.

We have been looking and working on moving to a new source but at the same time

moving base data into Gladheimur and then populating Dim/Fct?s from there. (FSLDM standard way of doing things.)   
The jobs/data flows are below marked as CURRENT and LONG TERM (bodi test).

Now we are looking into starting with a short term solution using the new source in the current setup that is using/loading the new sources directly into the dimensional model 
as we are doing in the current flows.   In this solution we would create new jobs/data-flows based on the main ones used in CURRENT solution. The main jobs are:

dim_loan_mc_job ,dim_loan_visa_job,fct_loan_Balance_mc_job, fct_loan_balance_visa_job

would be copied and changed to *_ns_* jobs/data flows.

dim_loan_mc_job ->dim_loan_mc_ns_job

dim_loan_visa_job-> dim_loan_visa_ns_job

fct_loan_Balance_mc_job-> fct_loan_Balance_mc_ns_job

fct_loan_balance_visa_job-> fct_loan_balance_visa_ns_job

Main change  is that instead of using the main old data sources:

stg_mc/visa_stg_upplys...

we woold use 

stg_cards_mv/visa_cards_tab/arc tables on bifrost.  

The new source is currently stg/arc daily on test and prod and include f.ex. better data like agreement_id.  Using the new source we would get following benefits:

The new source is ready earlier in the night, DW and RL would finish earlier.
We woold be in sink with Sopra Provision (DW, TÞú and RL)
The card jobs are slow (f.ex.lookup on agreement_id) and resource intensive so we can expect some performance gaines.
