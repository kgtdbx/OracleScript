--Task 237962:Cretae and test dim_loan_visa_ns_job
--https://tfs.isbank.is/tfs/DefaultCollection/HBL/_workitems/edit/237962
/*
New job dim_loan_visa_ns_job,
with new data flow and new work flow.

The data flow from the old job can be copied and used with some adjustments:

New source table bifrost.stg2_cards_visa_cards_tab instead of STG2_VISA_STG_UPPLYS_VISA_S.

Source table bifrost.stg_basel_facility_id_mapping is obsolete and should not be used any more. The column facility_id in dim_loan will be left empty.

Change filter in Table Comparison to: SOURCE_SYSTEM = 'VISA' and LOAN_TYPE = 'VISA', this will improve preformance.

For specific Query Transforms:
1) QT Q_stg and Q_JOINER: The columns GILDISTIMI and GILDISTIMI_INNL_AUKAHEIMILDAR are of type datetime they can be mapped directly.
2) QT Q_EXPRESSION: In mappings, use reference_date instead of banka_keyrsludags. 
3) QT Q_EXPRESSION: OVERDRAFT_LIMIT_EFFECTIVE_DATE <not ready yet>
4) QT Q_BRANCH_NAME: The Distinct rows option under Select is not needed.

In job, set Monitor sample rate to 300 seconds.
