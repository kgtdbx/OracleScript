SELECT 'ALTER TABLE BARS.' || OBJECT_NAME ||' MOVE TABLESPACE '||' BRSBIGD; '
FROM ALL_OBJECTS
WHERE OWNER = 'BARS'
AND OBJECT_TYPE = 'TABLE'
AND OBJECT_NAME = 'OW_OIC_REF'


Where <schema_name> is the name of the user. And <tablespace_name> is the destination tablespace.
As a result you get lines like:
ALTER TABLE SCOT.PARTS MOVE TABLESPACE USERS; 
Paste the results in a script or in a oracle sql developer like application and run it.
Moving indexes:
First run:

SELECT 'ALTER INDEX BARS.'||INDEX_NAME||' REBUILD TABLESPACE BRSBIGI ONLINE;' 
FROM ALL_INDEXES
WHERE OWNER = 'BARS'
AND TABLE_NAME = 'OW_OIC_REF'
AND TABLESPACE_NAME NOT LIKE 'BRSBIGI';

select * from all_indexes i
where i.TABLE_NAME = 'OW_OIC_REF'

The last line in this code could save you a lot of time because it filters out the indexes which are already in the correct tablespace.
As a result you should get something like:
ALTER INDEX SCOT.PARTS_NO_PK REBUILD TABLESPACE USERS;
Paste the results in a script or in a oracle sql developer like application and run it.
Last but not least, moving LOBs:
First run:
SELECT 'ALTER TABLE <schema_name>.'||LOWER(TABLE_NAME)||' MOVE LOB('||LOWER(COLUMN_NAME)||') STORE AS (TABLESPACE <table_space>);'
FROM DBA_TAB_COLS
WHERE OWNER = '<schema_name>' AND DATA_TYPE like '%LOB%';
This moves the LOB objects to the other tablespace.
As a result you should get something like:
ALTER TABLE SCOT.bin$6t926o3phqjgqkjabaetqg==$0 MOVE LOB(calendar) STORE AS (TABLESPACE USERS);
Paste the results in a script or in a oracle sql developer like application and run it.
O and there is one more thing:
For some reason I wasn't able to move 'DOMAIN' type indexes. 
As a work around I dropped the index. changed the default tablespace of the user into de desired tablespace. and then recreate the index again. 
There is propably a better way but it worked for me.
