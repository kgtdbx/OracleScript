How to purge a cursor from the shared pool using dbms_shared_pool
Find the address and hash value for the particular SQL you're looking for:
select address, hash_value from v$sqlarea where sql_id like 'bjkd7pcyfns86';


ADDRESS	            HASH_VALUE
0000000085CD2838    1021993222

Execute the purge procedure:
SQL> exec dbms_shared_pool.purge('0000000085CD2838, 1021993222','C');

Note that the name of the object is the combined values of address and hash value from v$sqlarea.
The value C is what you want to use for cursors.
