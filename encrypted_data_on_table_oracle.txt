Test case[edit]

Create a "wallet" directory in $ORACLE_BASE/admin/$ORACLE_SID where Oracle can store its encryption key. If not, you will get error: ORA-28368: cannot auto-create wallet. 
$ mkdir /app/oracle/admin/orcl/wallet


Create the wallet to hold the encryption key: 
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY AUTHENTICATED BY "secretpassword";


The above created wallet must be reopened after an instance restart: 
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET WALLET OPEN IDENTIFIED BY "secretpassword";


Create a table with encrypted columns: 
CREATE TABLE tde_test (
  id   NUMBER,
  data VARCHAR2(30) ENCRYPT
);
INSERT INTO tde_test (id, data) VALUES (1, 'This data in encrypted!');


Select from the table to see the data (wallet is still open): 
SQL>  SELECT data FROM tde_test;
DATA
------------------------------
This data in encrypted!


Closing the wallet to prevent access to encrypted columns: 
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET WALLET CLOSE;


Select from the table to see the data (wallet is closed): 
SQL> SELECT data FROM tde_test;
SELECT data FROM tde_test
                 *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-28365: wallet is not open
