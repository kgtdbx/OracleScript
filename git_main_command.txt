I've got a project checked locally from github, that remote repo has since had changes made to it. What's the correct command to update my local copy with the latest changes?
--
his should work for every default repo:
git pull origin master

If your default branch is different than master, you will need to specify the branch name:
git pull origin my_default_branch_name

--
This question is very general and there are a couple of assumptions I'll make to simplify it a bit. We'll assume that you want to update your master branch.

If you haven't made any changes locally, you can use git pull to bring down any new commits and add them to your master.

git pull origin master
If you have made changes, and you want to avoid adding a new merge commit, use git pull --rebase.

git pull --rebase origin master
git pull --rebase will work even if you haven't made changes and is probably your best call.


--####
--Git force pull to overwrite local files
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull origin master
--####

/*
$ git push origin master fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
*/

--first of all we need to check "origin" was setting up
git remote -v

-- it shows us all "push/fetch remotes" at our project
/* e.g.
$git remote -v
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (fetch)
myOrigin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git (push)

*/
--and if "origin" don't present there we could get the error when we entered
git push origin master

--in that case we just can use
$git push myOrigin master

--if you want change or delete URL, we need to delete old and then create new 
$git remote remove myOrigin

--the process of adding "remote"
$git remote add origin ssh://git@example.com:1234/myRepo.git

--then it works as expect
$git push origin master

------------------------------my solution--
--first of all we need to check "origin" was setting up
git remote -v

/*
OracleScript    https://github.com/sbovkush/OracleScript (fetch)
OracleScript    https://github.com/sbovkush/OracleScript (push)
*/
--if empty then
git remote add OracleScript https://github.com/sbovkush/OracleScript

--Git force pull to overwrite local files
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
git pull OracleScript master
git merge FETCH_HEAD

--or just use GitHub Desktop
/*
In GitHub Desktop, switch to the local branch you want to update by clicking "Current Branch" and selecting the branch from the list.
The Fetch origin button Click "Fetch origin" to update your branch.
The Pull origin button If there are commits on the remote branch, you can pull these by clicking "Pull origin".

--######################################--
Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.
Open Git Bash.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
git init

Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.

Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

Copy remote repository URL fieldAt the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.
In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote

git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
git push origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
