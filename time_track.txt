Try this, add the following at the beginning and it remembers the current time:

set serveroutput on
variable n number
exec :n := dbms_utility.get_time
Add this at the end and it calculates the time elapsed:

exec :n := (dbms_utility.get_time - :n)/100
exec dbms_output.put_line(:n)

It old question but i have found easy way to measure time of running a script in sqlplus. You just have to add this on the beginning

timing start timing_name
And this on the end of a script

timing stop
More information about this command can be found at Oracle's SQL*Plus® User's Guide and Reference: Collecting Timing Statistics

ot sure why everybody is making it so complex. Simple as:

SQL> set timing on
SQL> select 1 from dual;

         1
----------
         1

1 row selected.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL>
