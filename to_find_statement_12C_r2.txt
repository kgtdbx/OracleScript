Regarding this comment:

But there can be scenarios where it is difficult to identify where the ROLLBACK statement are executed in a complex PL SQL program (if you have to do only a modification to the existing code).

If you are running an Oracle Database 12c Release 2 instance (available now for download from OTN, Github and Docker, or multiple cloud services), you can take advantage of PL/Scope to find all the places in your code where commits and rollbacks are executed (PL/Scope was first added in 11.1, but analysis of SQL statements was added in 12.2):

You must first enable gathering of scope data:

ALTER SESSION SET plscope_settings='identifiers:all, statements:all'
Then when you compile program units, information is put into ALL_IDENTIFIERS (PL/SQL statements) and ALL_STATEMENTS (SQL statements, new to 12.2).

Once you have done that, the following queries will locate all commits and rollbacks:

SELECT st.owner,
       st.object_name,
       st.object_type,
       st.line,
       src.text
  FROM all_statements st, all_source src
 WHERE     st.TYPE = 'COMMIT'
       AND st.object_name = src.name
       AND st.owner = src.owner
       AND st.line = src.line
ORDER BY st.owner,
         st.object_name,
         st.object_type   
/

SELECT st.owner,
       st.object_name,
       st.object_type,
       st.line,
       src.text
  FROM all_statements st, all_source src
 WHERE     st.TYPE = 'ROLLBACK'
       AND st.object_name = src.name
       AND st.owner = src.owner
       AND st.line = src.line
ORDER BY st.owner,
         st.object_name,
         st.object_type    
/
